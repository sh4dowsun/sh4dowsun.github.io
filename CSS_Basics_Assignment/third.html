            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>The Munchkin is a breed of cat characterized by its very short legs. The Munchkin has similar characteristics to normal domestic cats, due to their frequent use as outcrosses. It is a small to medium-sized cat with a moderate body type and medium-plush coat. Male Munchkins typically weigh between 6 and 9 pounds (2.7 and 4.1 kg) and are usually larger than female Munchkins, which typically weigh between 4 and 8 pounds (1.8 and 3.6 kg). The Munchkin comes in all coat colors and patterns. It also comes in a long-haired variety. The short-haired variety has a medium-plush coat while the long-haired has a semi-long silky coat.</p>
